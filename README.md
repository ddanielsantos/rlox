## rlox
Implementation of Lox's tree walker interpreter, using Rust.

---

The goal of this project is to implement the jlox interpreter from the book "[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)" using Rust.

Lox is a small, dynamically-typed programming language that supports basic features like variables, control flow statements, functions, and classes.
